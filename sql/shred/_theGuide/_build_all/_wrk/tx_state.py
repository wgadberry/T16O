"""
tx_state.py: Transaction processing state bitmask constants

Each constant represents a bit in the tx.type_state column.
Use bitwise OR (|) to set bits, bitwise AND (&) to check bits.

Example:
    from tx_state import TxState

    # Set multiple phases
    new_state = TxState.SHREDDED | TxState.DECODED | TxState.GUIDE_EDGES

    # Check if phase is complete
    if current_state & TxState.TOKENS_ENRICHED:
        print("Tokens already enriched")

    # Check if phase is missing
    if not (current_state & TxState.FUNDING_COMPLETE):
        print("Needs funding resolution")
