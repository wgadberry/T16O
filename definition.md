# Prompt

I have a solution in a UI folder at the root folder.

There is a client and server app, the client has a menu item called analytics. Let's add a sub menus and create pages and route to the new pages from our sub menus.

The new pages will have components to show a bubble map, the data and implimentation of the bubble map will be the same as the example python and html files in the folder: \sql\shred\ClusterMaps

all credentials and database connections are the same as in the sample files.
